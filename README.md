## Step 1: Dataset
We chose the DomainNet Dataset where our source dataset type is the `real' images set, and we primarily focus on the infograph set of images as our target dataset for this project. As the required extension, we have decided to test this for other two datasets as well which include clipart, sketch. 

## Step 2: Model
We chose the CLIP model 

## Step 3: Task A - Zero Shot Evaluation 
We evaluate the CLIP model for the chosen datasets i.e. Real images and the Infographic images (TODO: report acc as a table) 

| Metric          | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| Real Images (Source) | 0.7863 |
| Inforgrah Images (Target)  | 0.4045  |

 
## Step 3: Task B - Finetuning on Real Images (Source Dataset)
TODO : finetune and report results (infograph, clipart, sketch)

## Step 4: Task C - Domain Adaptation 
TODO 

## Step 5: Analysis and Ablation studies
